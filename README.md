## Data

Data on trade in goods between the UK and the rest of the world are supplied
from the UN COMTRADE database. For ease of comparison across years, we use the
old SITC version 2 classification, which is available for data from the present
(ready-recategorised by COMTRADE) back to 1978.

We have mapped each SITC code onto the 20 sectors used by the ISSB statistics.
Each code is assigned or split between *components* and *final goods*, and given
an average steel content (in kg steel per kg product)

## Uses

This data was prepared for the *TBC report details*.
